::: notes
Hello everyone! My name is Gustavo. For those of you who don't know me, my name
is Gustavo and I'm currently in the fourth year of the PhD in economics. This
workshop will focus on how to apply the Git philosophy to teaching.

Now, let me warn you that I've been using git for only two years. And while
learning it has been a useful process, I'm far from "Git wizard". I would even
guess that some of you here in this audience know it better than me.

With that in mind, please don't think of this as a session of me teaching you
stuff. Feel free to interrupt me whenever, make suggestions, comments, etc.
Let's think of this more as a brainstorm.
