# Introduction

## About me
* Economics Ph.D. student, 4th year
* *Not* a specialist in: 
  1. Teaching
  2. Git

Hello everyone! My name is Gustavo. For those of you who don't know me, my name
is Gustavo and I'm currently in the fourth year of the PhD in economics. This
workshop will focus on how to apply the Git philosophy to teaching.

Now, let me warn you that I've been using git for only two years. And while
learning it has been a useful process, I'm far from "Git wizard". I would even
guess that some of you here in this audience know it better than me.

With that in mind, please don't think of this as a session of me teaching you
stuff. Feel free to interrupt me whenever, make suggestions, comments, etc.
Let's think of this more as a brainstorm.
:::
   
## Purpose of this talk
* Introduce basic Git concepts
* Discuss how Git can be useful for teaching

## Why should I care??
::: incremental
1. **Version control**. A good principle for life!
2. **Flexibility**. Customize your course
3. **Collaboration**. Work with your peers and students
:::

::: notes
1. If you haven't adopted version control yet, you should. Not only for teaching
   purposes, but for practical day to day life. The benefits will be there not
   only for coders. Anyone e.g. writing a thesis will benefit from version controlling. 
2. When you use git, a useful side effect is that you can easily port your code
   to hosting services. That way, you can make the course repository into an
   integral part of the course.

# Introducing Git

## Git *isn't*
- Github
- A big scary thing that's only useful for coders/hackers (omg cmd line)
- A substitute for Dropbox 

## Pros and cons
*Relative to not having version control*

Avoids this kind of thing:

## Pros and cons
*Relative to other version control methods*

- Large user base
- Easy! (Yes, I mean it)
- Ubiquitous
- TODO: Technical reasons
- Network externalities

::: notes
1. It has a large user base and all the advantages that come with it. My
   experience is that there are some common mistakes beginners make and you'll
   be able to google your way out of them very quickly.
2. It is truly easy once you get the gist of it.
3. Very easy to install and run. Pre-installed in most clusters and many linux
   distributions.
4. TODO
5. Related to (1), there are network externalities associated to it. This is not
   my favorite reason (Windows) but that doesn't mean it isn't true.
